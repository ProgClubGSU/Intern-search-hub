# Job Hunt Resource Hub

Before you start scrolling:  
Make sure you’re signed up for the talent networks of as many companies as possible — especially the ones with strong connections to your school or area. Recruiters often have KPIs tied to your university’s engagement, which means your name being in their system can literally improve your odds.

Also, keep an eye out for company events. Some are direct pipelines to hiring. A useful rule of thumb:  
The more exclusive the event and the more steps it takes to get in, the more valuable it’s likely to be for your job hunt.

## Startup-Focused Job Boards
Great for full-time roles, internships, or even unpaid projects that help you stack experience quickly. If you want to build your resume for bigger hunts later, these are worth checking often.

| Site | What It’s Good For | Quality / Notes |
|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| [Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/) (formerly AngelList) | Startups of all sizes, early-stage companies | Huge variety, but expect to sort through a lot of listings |
| [Startup Search / Board](https://startupsearch.com/) | Curated startup roles & internships | Smaller pool but more targeted |
| [Handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/) | Smaller companies, school-specific postings, job fairs | Often incomplete, updates slowly, but still worth a look |
| [YC Combinator Job Board](https://www.ycombinator.com/jobs) | Startup roles from YC-backed companies | More competitive, but the jobs are solid |
| [SubscriptionIntern](https://subscriptionintern.com/) | Curated internships & startup gigs | They do the searching for you — hit or miss depending on your field |

These are the everyday heavy hitters — the main tools in your job search kit.

|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| [LinkedIn Jobs](https://linkedin.com/jobs) | All industries, all locations | Probably the largest job pool, should be your main go-to |
| [Teal HQ](https://tealhq.com/) | Job tracking, application planning | Also great for finding old postings to understand hiring cycles |
| [OfferPilot](https://offerpilot.app/) | Job/internship tracking | Okay for browsing, but not always up to date |

## Quick Tips for Using These Resources
Apply early — many roles fill before the posted deadline.  
Use multiple platforms to widen your reach.  
Keep track of your applications in Teal HQ or a spreadsheet.  
Network alongside applying; cold DMs, coffee chats, and event signups can make a real difference.
